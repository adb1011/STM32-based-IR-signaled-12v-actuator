## Can Crusher - KiCad Project - IR Controlled 12V Linear Actuator Driver
This repository contains the KiCad schematic and design files for an electric can crusher project. The goal is to automate the process of crushing aluminum cans using a custom-designed electronic circuit and actuator system.

## Project Overview
This can crusher uses an 12V electric actuator controlled by a custom PCB designed in KiCad. The schematic outlines key components such as:
Power regulation
Motor/actuator driver circuit
Switches/sensors for start/stop and position detection
Protection components (e.g. flyback diodes, resistors)

## Contents
Schematic.pdf — Printable schematic overview of the circuit
